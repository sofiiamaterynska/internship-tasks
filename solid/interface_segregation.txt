larger interfaces should be split into smaller ones. By doing so, we can ensure that implementing 
classes only need to be concerned about the methods that are of interest to them.

public interface BearCleaner {
    void washTheBear();
}
 
public interface BearFeeder {
    void feedTheBear();
}
 
public interface BearPetter {
    void petTheBear();
}

public class BearCarer implements BearCleaner, BearFeeder {
 
    public void washTheBear() {
        //I think we missed a spot...
    }
 
    public void feedTheBear() {
        //Tuna Tuesdays...
    }
}


public class CrazyPerson implements BearPetter {
 
    public void petTheBear() {
        //Good luck with that!
    }
}
