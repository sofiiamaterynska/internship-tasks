Simply put, classes should be open for extension, but closed for 
modification. In doing so, we stop ourselves from modifying existing 
code and causing potential new bugs in an otherwise happy application.


public class Guitar {
 
    private String make;
    private String model;
    private int volume;
 
    //Constructors, getters & setters
}

We launch the application, and everyone loves it. However, after a few 
months, we decide the Guitar is a little bit boring and could do with an 
awesome flame pattern to make it look a bit more â€˜rock and roll'.


public class SuperCoolGuitarWithFlames extends Guitar {
 
    private String flameColor;
 
    //constructor, getters + setters
}
